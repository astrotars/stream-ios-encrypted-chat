# Encrypted Chat on iOS (Swift)

This repository serves as the base code for a tutorial on how to build an encrypted chat application with iOS (Swift).

In the tutorial, we (together) build encrypted chat on iOS using Swift. We'll combine [Stream Chat](https://getstream.io/chat/) and [Virgil Security](https://virgilsecurity.com/). Both Stream Chat and Virgil make it easy to create a solution with high security with all the features you expect. 

These two services allow developers to integrate chat that is zero-knowledge. The application embeds Virgil Security's [E3Kit](https://github.com/VirgilSecurity/virgil-e3kit-x) with [Stream Chat's Swift](https://github.com/GetStream/stream-chat-swift) components.
